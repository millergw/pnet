# Experiment: adding regularization to the first hidden layer of P-NET. Started 10/03/2024 by Gwen Miller.
# Specifically, trying to add {L1, L2, or elastic-net} regularization to the weights going to the gene layer.
# I will try varied levels of alpha for each regularization strategy to choose the method and amount of regularization to use in future experiments.
